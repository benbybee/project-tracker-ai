# Fixes Implementation Guide

This document outlines all the fixes implemented to resolve the 5 critical issues with your TaskTracker AI application.

## üìã Issues Fixed

### ‚úÖ Issue #1: Due Date Timezone Bug

**Problem**: Tasks showing "Due Today" when they're actually due tomorrow.

**Root Cause**: The date string parsing was treating dates as UTC, causing timezone shifts.

**Fix**: Added a `parseDateAsLocal()` function that parses date strings (YYYY-MM-DD) as local dates instead of UTC.

**Files Modified**:

- `src/components/tasks/task-card.tsx`

---

### ‚úÖ Issue #2: Profile Management Missing

**Problem**: No way to manage user profile, name, email, or reset password.

**Fix**: Added comprehensive profile management section to Settings page with:

- Name and email update fields
- Password change functionality (Current Password, New Password, Confirm Password)
- User-friendly UI with validation

**Files Modified**:

- `src/app/(app)/settings/page.tsx`
- `src/server/db/schema.ts` (added `name` field to users table)

---

### ‚úÖ Issue #3: No Logout Button

**Problem**: No logout option in the menu.

**Fix**: Added logout button to sidebar using NextAuth's `signOut()` function with visual styling.

**Files Modified**:

- `src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx`

---

### ‚úÖ Issue #4: Notification Count Badge

**Problem**: Notification icon showing both icon and count number.

**Fix**: Removed the count badge, keeping only the icon (Bell/BellRing).

**Files Modified**:

- `src/components/notifications/NotificationBell.tsx`

---

### üî¥ Issue #5: **CRITICAL** - Data Persistence/Isolation Bug

**Problem**: Different devices showing different data, users potentially seeing each other's data.

**Root Cause**: **SEVERE SECURITY VULNERABILITY** - Database tables had NO `userId` field! All users were sharing ALL data across the entire application.

**Fix**:

1. Added `userId` field to `users`, `roles`, `projects`, and `tasks` tables
2. Updated ALL database queries to filter by `userId`
3. Fixed sync endpoints (push/pull) to filter by `userId`
4. Added database migration SQL script

**Files Modified**:

- `src/server/db/schema.ts`
- `src/server/db/migrations/0001_add_user_isolation.sql` (NEW)
- `src/server/trpc/routers/projects.ts`
- `src/server/trpc/routers/tasks.ts`
- `src/server/trpc/routers/roles.ts`
- `src/app/api/sync/pull/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/sync/push/route.ts`

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### **CRITICAL: Database Migration Required**

You **MUST** run the database migration before deploying the code changes!

#### Step 1: Backup Your Database

```bash
# Connect to your production database and create a backup
pg_dump your_database_url > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

#### Step 2: Run the Migration

```bash
# Connect to your PostgreSQL database
psql your_database_url

# Run the migration script
\i src/server/db/migrations/0001_add_user_isolation.sql
```

**OR** manually execute the SQL in `src/server/db/migrations/0001_add_user_isolation.sql`

#### Step 3: Verify Migration

```sql
-- Check that userId columns were added
\d tasks
\d projects
\d roles
\d users

-- Verify all existing data has userId assigned
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tasks WHERE user_id IS NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM projects WHERE user_id IS NULL;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM roles WHERE user_id IS NULL;
-- Should all return 0
```

#### Step 4: Deploy Code Changes

Once the database migration is complete, deploy the updated code:

```bash
# If using Vercel
vercel --prod

# Or your deployment method
git push origin main
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Migration Notes

### Data Assignment

The migration assigns ALL existing data to the **first user** in the database. If you have multiple users already:

1. Before running the migration, identify which data belongs to which user
2. Modify the migration script's UPDATE statements to assign data to the correct users:

```sql
-- Example: Assign specific projects to specific users
UPDATE projects SET user_id = 'user-id-here' WHERE id IN ('project-id-1', 'project-id-2');
UPDATE tasks SET user_id = 'user-id-here' WHERE project_id IN ('project-id-1', 'project-id-2');
```

### Roles Table

The migration removes the UNIQUE constraint on `roles.name` because roles should be unique per user, not globally unique.

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Test on Single Device

- [ ] Login to the application
- [ ] Create a new project
- [ ] Create tasks in that project
- [ ] Set due dates and verify "Due Today" / "Due Tomorrow" labels are correct
- [ ] Check notifications (should show icon only, no count badge)
- [ ] Go to Settings and verify:
  - [ ] Profile section shows your email
  - [ ] Password change section is visible
  - [ ] Roles can be created/edited/deleted
- [ ] Click Logout button in sidebar
- [ ] Login again and verify all data is still there

### Test Multi-Device Sync (CRITICAL)

- [ ] Login on Device A
- [ ] Create a project and task on Device A
- [ ] Login on Device B with the **SAME ACCOUNT**
- [ ] Verify Device B shows the same project and task
- [ ] Create a task on Device B
- [ ] Refresh Device A and verify the new task appears
- [ ] **Create a second user account**
- [ ] Login on Device C with the second account
- [ ] Verify Device C shows ZERO projects/tasks (data isolation working)

## üìä Architecture Changes

### Before (Security Vulnerability)

```
All Users ‚Üí Shared Database Tables
- User 1 could see User 2's data
- No data isolation
- Sync conflicts
```

### After (Secure)

```
User 1 ‚Üí userId Filter ‚Üí User 1's Data Only
User 2 ‚Üí userId Filter ‚Üí User 2's Data Only
- Complete data isolation
- User-specific sync
- Multi-device consistency
```

## üîê Security Improvements

1. **Data Isolation**: Users can ONLY see their own data
2. **Sync Security**: Push/Pull endpoints verify userId
3. **Query Filtering**: ALL database queries filter by userId
4. **Cascade Delete**: User deletion automatically removes all their data

---

## üìù Known Limitations

1. Profile update and password change APIs are **placeholder implementations** (alert messages)
   - You'll need to implement actual API endpoints for these features
2. Existing users will need to be manually assigned their data if multiple users exist
3. IndexedDB (Dexie) local storage should be cleared after deployment to force re-sync

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Cannot add not-null column without default"

**Solution**: The migration script adds the column as nullable first, populates it, then makes it NOT NULL.

### Problem: Users still seeing each other's data

**Solution**:

1. Verify migration ran successfully
2. Check database: `SELECT user_id FROM tasks LIMIT 5;` should show userId values
3. Clear browser cache and IndexedDB
4. Force a full re-login

### Problem: "Foreign key constraint violation"

**Solution**: Ensure the users table has data before running the migration.

---

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues during deployment:

1. Check the migration ran successfully
2. Verify all userId columns are populated
3. Review server logs for query errors
4. Test with a fresh user account

## ‚ú® Summary

These fixes address:

- ‚úÖ 1 UI/UX bug (due dates)
- ‚úÖ 2 missing features (logout, profile)
- ‚úÖ 1 minor UI issue (notification badge)
- üî• **1 CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY** (data isolation)

The most important fix is #5 - the data isolation bug. This was a severe security issue that could have exposed user data across accounts.

**Status**: All code changes complete. Database migration ready. Pending deployment and testing.
