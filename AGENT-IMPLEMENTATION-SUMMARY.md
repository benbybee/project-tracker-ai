# AI Agent Chat - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

### Phase 0: Fixed AI Analytics Chat (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** The existing AI Analytics Assistant was giving incorrect answers due to:
- Status value mismatches in database queries
- Missing temporal data (tasks created/completed this week/month)
- Incomplete context for the AI

**Solution:** Updated `src/app/api/ai/analytics-chat/route.ts`
- Fixed status values to handle both `in_progress`/`in-progress` and `not_started`/`not-completed` variants
- Added temporal queries:
  - Tasks created this week/month
  - Tasks completed this week/month
- Added blocked task counts
- Enhanced AI system prompt with recent activity data

**Result:** AI Analytics Chat now provides accurate answers to questions like:
- "How many tasks did I add this week?" ‚úÖ
- "How many tasks are due today?" ‚úÖ
- "Show me my recent activity" ‚úÖ

### Phase 1: Core Agent Engine

**File: `src/lib/ai/agent-engine.ts`**
- Built `AgentEngine` class with OpenAI Function Calling integration
- Defined 12 function schemas for agent capabilities:
  - Projects: create, update, delete, search
  - Tasks: create, update, delete, search, changeStatus, getSummary
  - Notes: create, update, delete, search
  - Analytics: getProjectStats, generateReport
- Implemented rate limiting:
  - 10 commands per minute per user
  - 50 commands per hour per user
- Retry logic with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts)
- Action classification (simple vs complex requiring approval)

---

### Phase 2: Action Executors

**Directory: `src/lib/ai/agent-actions/`**

Created type-safe action executors with authorization and validation:

1. **projects.actions.ts**
   - `executeCreateProject`: Create new projects with embeddings
   - `executeUpdateProject`: Update project details
   - `executeDeleteProject`: Delete with cascade (requires approval)
   - `executeSearchProjects`: Filter and search projects

2. **tasks.actions.ts**
   - `executeCreateTask`: Create tasks with project lookup by name
   - `executeUpdateTask`: Update task properties
   - `executeDeleteTask`: Remove tasks (requires approval)
   - `executeSearchTasks`: Advanced filtering (status, overdue, etc.)
   - `executeChangeTaskStatus`: Update status with blocked reason support
   - `executeGetTaskSummary`: Get filtered task summaries

3. **notes.actions.ts**
   - `executeCreateNote`: Create notes with project lookup
   - `executeUpdateNote`: Update note content
   - `executeDeleteNote`: Remove notes (requires approval)
   - `executeSearchNotes`: Search by content and project

4. **analytics.actions.ts**
   - `executeGetProjectStats`: Detailed project statistics
   - `executeGenerateReport`: Daily/weekly/monthly reports

**Security Features:**
- All actions verify user ownership
- Zod schema validation for inputs
- Authorization checks before any CRUD operation
- Activity logging for audit trail

---

### Phase 3: Agent tRPC Router

**File: `src/server/trpc/routers/agent.ts`**

Implemented 4 tRPC procedures:
1. **executeCommand**: Parse natural language and execute/propose actions
2. **approveActions**: Execute approved complex actions
3. **getCapabilities**: List available functions with examples
4. **healthCheck**: Verify OpenAI connectivity

**Features:**
- Context-aware: Provides recent projects and tasks to AI
- Intelligent routing: Simple actions execute immediately, complex need approval
- Error handling: Retry logic with detailed error messages
- Real-time results: Returns execution status and data

**Added to:** `src/server/trpc/root.ts`

---

### Phase 4: UI Components

**1. AgentMessageBubble Component**
**File: `src/components/chat/AgentMessageBubble.tsx`**

Beautiful, interactive message bubbles with:
- Status indicators (thinking, executing, completed, failed, approval needed)
- Expandable execution logs
- Approval interface with checkboxes
- Retry count display
- Impact warnings for destructive actions

**2. AI Chat Page**
**File: `src/app/(app)/ai-chat/page.tsx`**

Full-featured agent chat interface with:
- Chat/Agent mode toggle
- Real-time message updates
- Approval workflow for complex actions
- Quick action buttons
- Loading states and error handling
- Toast notifications for feedback

**Features:**
- Smooth animations with Framer Motion
- Responsive design
- Dark mode support (via existing theme)
- Accessible keyboard navigation

---

### Phase 5: Documentation

**File: `docs/agent-examples.md`**

Comprehensive guide including:
- How to use the agent
- 50+ command examples organized by category
- Understanding agent responses
- Troubleshooting guide
- Security notes
- Advanced usage patterns
