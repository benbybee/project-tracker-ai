# Plaud Audio URL Manual Extraction Guide

## Problem Identified

The Plaud share page uses **client-side rendering** to load audio dynamically via JavaScript. This means:

- ❌ The audio URL is NOT in the initial HTML
- ❌ Server-side scraping cannot capture it
- ❌ The page loads a JavaScript app that fetches the audio after page load
- ✅ The audio URL IS accessible in the browser's Network tab

## Debug Results Summary

From your debug output:

- **HTML Length**: Only 2,162 bytes (very small - just a shell)
- **Has Next.js Data**: ❌ No (not a Next.js app)
- **Audio URLs Found**: 0
- **API Endpoints**: Return HTML, not JSON

This confirms the page is a **Single Page Application (SPA)** that loads content dynamically.

## Solution 1: Manual Audio URL Extraction (Immediate)

### Steps to Find the Audio URL

1. **Open the Plaud share link** in your browser:

   ```
   https://web.plaud.ai/share/61071761620824397
   ```

2. **Open DevTools**:
   - Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows)
   - Or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)

3. **Go to the Network Tab**:
   - Click on "Network" tab in DevTools
   - Make sure "All" or "Media" filter is selected

4. **Reload the page**:
   - Press `F5` or click the refresh button
   - Watch the network requests as the page loads

5. **Look for audio file requests**:
   - Look for files ending in `.mp3`, `.m4a`, `.wav`, or `.ogg`
   - Or filter by "Media" type
   - Right-click on the audio request → "Copy" → "Copy URL"

6. **Alternative - Check the page source**:
   - After the page loads, right-click → "Inspect"
   - Look for `<audio>` tags or `<source>` tags
   - The audio URL should be in the `src` attribute

### What to Do With the Audio URL

Once you have the audio URL:

1. **Option A**: Download the audio file directly and upload it via the Plaud webhook
2. **Option B**: Contact me with the audio URL pattern so I can add it to the extraction logic
3. **Option C**: If the URL requires authentication, the share link may be private

## Solution 2: Server-Side Rendering (Requires Code Change)

To fix this permanently, we need to use a headless browser approach:

### Option A: Puppeteer (Heavy but Reliable)

```bash
npm install puppeteer
```

Then modify `src/lib/plaud-import.ts` to use Puppeteer to render the page and extract the audio URL after JavaScript executes.

**Pros**:

- Reliable
- Works with any client-side rendered page

**Cons**:

- Adds ~300MB to deployment size
- Slower (takes 5-10 seconds)
- More expensive on Vercel

### Option B: Playwright (Lighter Alternative)

```bash
npm install playwright-core playwright-chromium
```

Similar to Puppeteer but more lightweight.

### Option C: Use Plaud's Official API

If Plaud has an official API, we should use that instead of scraping.

**Action**: Check Plaud's documentation for an official API endpoint:

- https://plaud.ai/docs
- https://developer.plaud.ai

## Solution 3: Browser Extension Approach

Create a browser extension that:

1. Runs on the Plaud share page
2. Extracts the audio URL after page load
3. Sends it to your API

This would work for personal use but requires installing an extension.

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Manual Workaround):

1. **Use DevTools to find the audio URL** (see steps above)
2. **Download the audio file**
3. **Upload via a different method** (if available)

### Short Term (Quick Fix):

1. **Check if Plaud has an official API**
2. If yes, use that API instead of scraping
3. If no, contact Plaud support to ask about programmatic access

### Long Term (Robust Solution):

Implement one of these approaches:

**Option 1**: Puppeteer/Playwright for server-side rendering

- Best for automation
- Works with any Plaud link
- More expensive

**Option 2**: Official Plaud API integration

- Best for reliability
- Proper authentication
- Dependent on Plaud providing API access

**Option 3**: Create a browser extension

- Works for personal use
- No server-side changes needed
- Requires manual installation

## Why This Is Happening

Modern web apps (like Plaud's share page) use frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular that:

1. Load a minimal HTML shell
2. Execute JavaScript to fetch data via AJAX
3. Render the content dynamically

Traditional web scraping only sees the initial HTML shell, not the dynamically loaded content.

## Questions to Answer

To help you further, I need to know:

1. **Can you find the audio URL in Network tab?** (Follow steps above)
2. **Does Plaud have an official API?** (Check their docs)
3. **Is the share link definitely public?** (Try in incognito mode)
4. **What's your preferred solution?**
   - Manual extraction (quick but manual)
   - Puppeteer implementation (robust but heavy)
   - Official API (best if available)

## Contact Support

If the audio URL requires authentication or the share is private:

- The share link may have expired
- The recording may not be publicly accessible
- You may need to re-share with public access enabled

Let me know what you find in the Network tab, and I can help implement the appropriate solution!
