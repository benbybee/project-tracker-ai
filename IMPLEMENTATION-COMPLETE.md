# Implementation Complete: Project Notes & Plaud Link Import

## üéâ Build Status

‚úÖ **All features implemented and building successfully**
‚úÖ **No TypeScript or linting errors**
‚úÖ **Ready for manual testing and deployment**

---

## üìã What Was Built

### Feature 1: Project-Specific Notes

**Location**: Project Detail Pages (`/projects/[id]`)

**New Components Created**:

- `ProjectNotesSection.tsx` - Main notes display component with filtering and actions
- `ProjectNoteModal.tsx` - Modal for creating/editing notes with project auto-assignment

**Functionality**:

- Display notes filtered by current project
- Create text or audio notes directly from project page
- Auto-transcription for audio notes
- Search and filter by note type
- View, edit, delete actions
- AI task generation from notes
- Responsive design (table view on desktop, cards on mobile)

### Feature 2: Manual Plaud Link Import

**Location**: Plaud AI Ingestion Page (`/plaud`)

**New Files Created**:

- `plaud-import.ts` - Utility to fetch and parse audio from Plaud share links
- `api/plaud/import-link/route.ts` - API endpoint for link-based import

**Functionality**:

- Import section at top of Plaud page
- Input Plaud share link (e.g., `https://web.plaud.ai/share/[id]`)
- Optional project assignment
- Automatic transcription via OpenAI Whisper
- AI task extraction via GPT-4
- Tasks flow into pending items for review
- Error handling for invalid links

---

## üîß Bug Fixes Applied

1. **Project Name Lookup** (Critical Fix)
   - Fixed import-link API to store project NAME instead of ID in `suggestedProjectName`
   - Removed incorrect `ownerId` check (projects don't have ownership in this app)
   - Now correctly looks up project name when projectId is provided

2. **Code Formatting**
   - Fixed Prettier formatting issues in import-link route

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Files (4):

```
src/components/projects/ProjectNotesSection.tsx

src/app/(app)/projects/[id]/page.tsx       - Added ProjectNotesSection
src/types/plaud.ts                         - Added import types
```

### Additional Modified Files (unrelated to this build):

```
src/app/(app)/settings/page.tsx

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Quick Test - Project Notes

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to any project: `/projects/[id]`
3. Scroll down to "Project Notes" section
4. Click "Add Note"
5. Verify project name is pre-filled
6. Create a text note
7. Verify it appears in the list

### Quick Test - Plaud Import

1. Navigate to `/plaud`
2. Find "Import from Plaud Link" section at top
3. Try invalid URL first to test error handling
4. Input valid Plaud share link
5. Optionally select a project
6. Click "Import"
7. Verify success message and task count
8. Verify tasks appear in pending list below

### Full Test Checklist

See `TEST-VERIFICATION.md` for comprehensive testing checklist

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set (required for both features)
- [ ] Test with real Plaud share links
- [ ] Verify database migrations are applied
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Monitor OpenAI API usage and costs
- [ ] Set up error logging/monitoring
- [ ] Test audio transcription quality
- [ ] Verify AI task extraction accuracy

## üí° Architecture Decisions

### Why Project Name Instead of ID?

The `plaud_pending` table stores `suggestedProjectName` (text field) to suggest which project tasks should belong to. When users accept tasks, they can either:

1. Select an existing project
2. Create a new project with the suggested name

Storing the project NAME (not ID) allows flexibility - if the project is deleted, the suggestion still makes sense. Users can create a new project with that name.

### Why Not Store Audio Files?

Audio files are transcribed immediately and discarded to:

1. Save storage costs
2. Simplify backup/restore
3. Avoid GDPR/privacy concerns with audio storage
4. Transcripts are sufficient for task extraction

Users can always re-upload audio if needed.

### Project Access Model

This application uses a shared project model where:

- All authenticated users can access all projects
- No per-user project ownership
- Access control is handled at the authentication level

---

## üìä Dependencies

All required packages are already installed:

- `openai` - Whisper transcription & GPT-4
- `drizzle-orm` - Database queries
- `next-auth` - Authentication
- UI components from `shadcn/ui`

No new packages were added.

## üîó Integration Points

### Existing APIs Used

- `/api/notes/list?projectId=...` - Fetch project notes
- `/api/notes/create` - Create notes
- `/api/notes/transcribe` - Audio transcription
- `/api/notes/ai/generate-tasks` - AI task extraction
- `/api/plaud/pending` - List pending items
- `/api/plaud/accept` - Accept and create tasks

### New API Created

- `/api/plaud/import-link` - Manual Plaud link import

### Database Tables Used

- `notes` - Stores all notes (text and audio)
- `plaud_pending` - Stores pending task proposals
- `projects` - Project metadata
- `tasks` - Final accepted tasks

---

## üìù Next Steps

### Immediate

1. Run manual UI tests (see TEST-VERIFICATION.md)
2. Test with real Plaud share links
3. Verify audio quality and transcription accuracy
4. Test on mobile devices

### Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add audio file storage option
- Support bulk note import
- Add note categories/tags
- Add collaborative note editing
- Export notes to different formats
- Add note templates
