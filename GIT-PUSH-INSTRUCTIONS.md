# Git Push Instructions

Your code has been committed locally. To push to GitHub, follow these steps:

## Option 1: If you already have a GitHub repository

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

## Option 2: Create a new GitHub repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository (e.g., `project-tracker-ai`)
3. DO NOT initialize it with README, .gitignore, or license
4. Copy the repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/project-tracker-ai.git`)
5. Run these commands:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\Ben Bybee\Desktop\Cursor\project-tracker-ai-main"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/project-tracker-ai.git
git push -u origin master
```

## After Pushing

Once pushed to GitHub, Vercel will automatically:
1. Detect the new commit
2. Build your application
3. Deploy to production

**IMPORTANT:** Before Vercel deploys successfully, you must:
1. Run the database migration on your production database (see SETTINGS-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md)
2. Ensure all environment variables are set in Vercel

## Verify Deployment

After Vercel deploys:
1. Go to your app's settings page
2. Test profile editing (name and email)
3. Test password change
4. Test logout functionality
