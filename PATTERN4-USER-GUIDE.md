## Troubleshooting

### No Active Sprint Showing

**Problem:** Can't see your sprint in the overview
**Solution:** 
- Check if sprint was marked inactive
- Create a new sprint if needed
- Only one sprint can be active at a time

### Weeks Not Generating

**Problem:** "Generate 13 Weeks" button not working
**Solution:**
- Ensure you have an active sprint
- Check that weeks haven't already been generated
- Refresh the page and try again

### Opportunity Progress Not Updating

**Problem:** Task progress not showing on opportunity
**Solution:**
- Ensure tasks are linked to the opportunity
- Tasks must have `opportunityId` field set
- Progress calculates from task status

### Financial Calculations Wrong

**Problem:** Profit doesn't match expected value
**Solution:**
- Formula: profit = revenue - actualCost
- Ensure actualCost is populated
- Check that revenue is entered correctly
- System auto-calculates, don't enter profit manually
