   - Provide information from your data

## Understanding Agent Responses

### Immediate Execution (Simple Actions)
When you create, update, or search for items, the agent executes immediately and shows results:
- ‚úÖ **Completed**: Action succeeded
- ‚ùå **Failed**: Action failed with error message
- üîÑ **Retried**: Action was retried after failure

### Approval Required (Complex Actions)
Destructive actions require your approval:
- Delete project
- Delete task
- Bulk operations

The agent will show:
- **Action details**: What will be done
- **Impact warning**: What will be affected
- **Approval buttons**: Approve or Cancel

### Response Mode
For informational queries, the agent provides conversational responses with data from your system.

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be Specific**: Include project names, task IDs, or search terms
2. **Use Context**: The agent knows your recent projects and tasks
3. **Natural Language**: Write as you would to a colleague
4. **Multi-step Commands**: You can combine actions like "Create project X and add 3 tasks"

## Common Patterns

### Project + Task Creation
```
Create a project "Mobile App" and add tasks:
- Design mockups
- Implement authentication
- Set up backend
```

### Status Updates
```
Mark all my overdue tasks as in progress
Complete task ABC123 and add a note
```

### Search + Action
```
Find all blocked tasks and show me why they're blocked
List overdue tasks and mark them as high priority
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Project not found"**
- Check project name spelling
- Use exact project name or provide project ID
- List projects first: "Show me all my projects"

**"Rate limit exceeded"**
- You can send 10 commands per minute
- Maximum 50 commands per hour
- Wait a moment and try again

**"Approval required"**
- Review the action details carefully
- Check the impact warning
- Select actions to approve or cancel all

## Advanced Usage

### Using Project Context
The agent remembers your recent projects:
```
Add a task to my latest project
Create a task in the project I just created
```

### Filtering and Searching
```
Show tasks due within 3 days
Find high priority tasks in project ABC
List all completed tasks this week
```

### Batch Operations
```
Mark all these tasks as completed: [task1, task2, task3]
Create 5 tasks for the website redesign checklist
```

## Security Notes

- All actions execute with your user permissions
- Destructive actions always require approval
- The agent cannot access other users' data
- Rate limits prevent abuse

## Feedback

If the agent doesn't understand your command:
- Try rephrasing more specifically
- Break complex commands into steps
- Use the quick action buttons for examples
- Check this documentation for supported patterns
